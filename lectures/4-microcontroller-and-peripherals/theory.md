# Theory - KL25Z Microcontroller and Peripherals Overview

## 1. ARM Cortex-M0 Processor Family

- The Cortex-M0 is a 32-bit ARM processor designed for low power and cost-sensitive applications.  
- Operates up to 48 MHz with Thumb instruction set.  
- Suitable for embedded systems requiring efficient performance and low energy consumption.

## 2. Kinetis KL2x MCU Family

- KL25Z belongs to the Kinetis KL2x family by NXP.  
- Features include multiple GPIO ports, integrated analog peripherals, and communication interfaces.  
- MCU packaged in 80-pin LQFP with 128 KB Flash and 16 KB SRAM.

## 3. KL25Z Freedom Board

- Development board for rapid prototyping with KL25Z MCU.  
- Exposes pins for easy connection to sensors, actuators, and peripherals.  
- Includes RGB LEDs and integrated accelerometer accessible via I2C.

## 4. Power Supply and Clock

- Power supplied through USB or external sources regulated to 3.3 V.  
- Power schematics detail voltage regulators and decoupling capacitors.  
- System Integration Module (SIM) manages clock gating and power modes for peripherals.  
- Enabling/disabling peripheral clocks saves power and reduces noise.

## 5. Internal Buses

- **AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus):** Connects CPU to memory and high-speed peripherals.  
- **APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus):** Lower speed bus for peripherals with simpler interface.

## 6. Peripherals Overview

- GPIO ports A-E, each with 32 pins configurable as input/output.  
- Timers for event counting and pulse generation.  
- ADC for analog to digital conversion.  
- DAC for analog output.  
- PWM for controlling motors, LEDs, and other devices.  
- Communication: UART, SPI, I2C for serial data transfer.

## 7. Sensors and LEDs

- 3-axis accelerometer accessible via I2C interface.  
- RGB LEDs on board controlled by GPIO pins.

## 8. Register and Peripheral Programming

- MCU peripherals controlled by memory-mapped registers.  
- Bitwise operations required to set, clear, or toggle bits without affecting others.  
- Common registers: PCR (Pin Control Register), PDDR (Port Data Direction Register), PDOR, PSOR, PCOR, PDIR.

## 9. Power Management and Low Power Modes

- MCU supports multiple power modes to optimize energy consumption.  
- Clock gating disables unused peripherals to save power.  
- Sleep and stop modes reduce core activity when idle.
